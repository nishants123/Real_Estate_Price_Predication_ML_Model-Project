# Real_Estate_Price_Predication_ML_Model-Project

🏠 Project Overview:

This project aims to predict real estate property prices using machine learning. By analyzing features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms, the model helps estimate a property's market value. The process involved cleaning and analyzing the data, engineering useful features, comparing multiple regression models using cross-validation, and selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy and generalization.
